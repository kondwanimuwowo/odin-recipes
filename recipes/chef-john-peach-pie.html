    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This peach pie is above and beyond beautiful. The lattice design is also very practical. When making pie with something like peaches, the relatively open top allows lots of moisture to evaporate, which helps prevent the dreaded watery pie syndrome. That's also why we boil the excess juices into syrup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds fresh freestone peaches, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1 tiny pinch salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour/li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 14.1 ounce package double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter, cut into tiny pieces</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon heavy whipping cream, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stir together peaches, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt in a large bowl until combined; let sit for 20 to 30 minutes. Strain accumulated juices into a saucepan and return strained peaches to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Bring juices in the saucepan to a boil; reduce heat to medium-high and cook until mixture thickens to a syrup, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk together 1/2 cup sugar, flour, and cornstarch in a medium bowl. Stir lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon into peaches; sprinkle with flour mixture and toss to coat. Pour hot peach syrup over peach mixture and stir.</li>
        <li>Roll out one pastry into a 12-inch circle. Press into the bottom of a 10-inch pie plate. Pour peach filling into crust, tap the pie plate against a flat surface to settle filling, and dot with butter.</li>
        <li>Roll remaining pastry into an 11-inch circle and cut into 1-inch strips using a paring knife or pastry wheel.</li>
        <li>Lay 5 pastry dough strips evenly over the top of pie. Weave remaining pastry dough strips through to form a lattice top. Fold the ends of lattice strips under bottom crust and crimp crust to seal. Brush cream over the top and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is browned and filling is bubbly, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool completely before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
